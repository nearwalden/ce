*Citizen Engineer* is a fusion of ideas, information, advice, and opinions from
 the authors, their colleagues, and dozens of other sources, brought together to
 provide engineers with the tools and insights in the new era socially
 responsible engineering.\n\nThe book is most relevant to engineers who design
 and build “things” — engineers in fields such as electronic/computer
 engineering, software engineering, mechanical engineering, materials
 engineering, automotive engineering, and so forth—although we believe engineers
 in all disciplines, managers of engineers, and even consumers will find useful
 information in this book. \n\nThe subjects in each section can get enormously
 deep, so we’ve tried to a basic understanding, along with pointers for further
 investigation. We hope you’ll find the book useful in structuring your thinking
 and answering key questions about your role as an engineer in today's world.

After the turn of the century, Greg Papadapoulos and I began to notice some
recurring themes in our work with the engineers at Sun Microsystems and
elsewhere.\n\nFirst, an increasing number of engineers, especially those right
out of school, were expressing a desire to \"make a difference\". Some had a
hobby or activity they were already invested in outside of their work, while
others were searching for something that would make them more fulfilled. Many
were also bringing that sense into the office, and trying to see how they could
use their job to make a difference beyond the bottom line of Sun.\n\nSecond, the
world at large was asking more of engineers. Public knowledge about topics like
recycling, copyright, privacy, and climate change translated into new demands on
manufacturers of products and services, which, in turn, required new ways of
thinking in engineering.\n\nGenerally this was good news: we had engineers who
want to make a difference, and a public with rising expectations of them. In
2006 Greg wrote the first blog post about this entitled Charting a Course from
Recent Grad to “Citizen Engineer”, which launched a more focused discussion of
Citizen Engineers and their role in the new century.\n\nHowever, as we began to
discuss this more, it quickly became clear that engineers, including ourselves,
had missed out on some important topics during our educations. In particular,
engineers were being asked to make increasingly complex decisions about
environmental impact and intellectual property, but had never had any formal
training in either area.\n\nSo we set out to write Citizen Engineer with a
couple of goals in mind. First, we wanted to promote the idea that engineers
could, and should, take a more visible role in shaping our future world. Second,
we wanted to fill in some of the basic knowledge gaps that we found to be
widespread through the engineering community. Finally, we had a point of view
about the role of engineering and how to approach these complex issues which we
wanted to get across.\n","html":"<p><em>by Dave Douglas</em></p>\n\n<p>After the
